      "Finding the lowest point (often called a **minimum value** or **local minimum**, or even **absolute minimum**) of a function using calculus is a fundamental optimization problem. Here's a breakdown of the steps and the underlying principles:\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### The Core Idea: What Calculus Tells Us\n",
      "\n",
      "At a local minimum of a smooth function, the tangent line to the curve is horizontal. This means the slope of the tangent line is zero. In calculus, the slope of the tangent line is given by the **first derivative** of the function.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the first step is always to find where the first derivative is zero (or undefined). These points are called **critical points**.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### Steps to Find a Lowest Point:\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's say you have a function $f(x)$ and you want to find its minimum value.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Step 1: Find the First Derivative ($f'(x)$).**\n",
      "This derivative tells you the slope of the function at any point $x$.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Step 2: Find the Critical Points.**\n",
      "Set the first derivative equal to zero and solve for $x$:\n",
      "$f'(x) = 0$\n",
      "Also, look for points where $f'(x)$ is **undefined** (e.g., division by zero, square root of a negative number in the derivative). These are all critical points.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Step 3: Classify the Critical Points (Determine if they are Minima, Maxima, or Neither).**\n",
      "There are two primary tests for this:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Method A: The First Derivative Test**\n",
      "    1.  Pick test points to the immediate left and right of each critical point.\n",
      "    2.  Evaluate $f'(x)$ at these test points.\n",
      "    3.  **If $f'(x)$ changes from negative to positive** as you move across the critical point from left to right, then you have a **local minimum**.\n",
      "        *   (Negative slope means the function is decreasing, positive slope means it's increasing. So, decreasing then increasing implies a valley).\n",
      "    4.  If $f'(x)$ changes from positive to negative, it's a local maximum.\n",
      "    5.  If $f'(x)$ does not change sign, it's typically an inflection point (neither a min nor a max).\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Method B: The Second Derivative Test**\n",
      "    1.  Find the second derivative of the function, $f''(x)$.\n",
      "    2.  Plug each critical point (found in Step 2) into $f''(x)$.\n",
      "    3.  **If $f''(x) > 0$** at a critical point, then that point corresponds to a **local minimum**.\n",
      "        *   (Positive second derivative means the function is concave up, like a cup, which holds a minimum).\n",
      "    4.  If $f''(x) < 0$, it's a local maximum.\n",
      "    5.  If $f''(x) = 0$, the test is inconclusive. You must use the First Derivative Test instead.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Step 4: Find the Minimum Value(s).**\n",
      "Once you've identified the x-coordinates of the local minima, plug these x-values back into the *original function* $f(x)$ to find the corresponding y-values (the actual minimum values).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Step 5: Consider Endpoints (for Absolute Minima on a Closed Interval).**\n",
      "If you are looking for the **absolute minimum** of a function on a **closed interval** $[a, b]$:\n",
      "1.  Find all local minima within the interval using the steps above.\n",
      "2.  Evaluate the function at the endpoints: $f(a)$ and $f(b)$.\n",
      "3.  Compare all the y-values (from local minima and endpoints). The smallest of these is the absolute minimum on the interval.\n",

You typically only guarantee an absolute minimum (and maximum) on a continuous function over a closed and bounded interval.\n"
